# We'll do this by opening Xcode with the files we've created

# For now, you can manually create the project in Xcode:
# 1. Open Xcode
# 2. File > New > Project
# 3. Choose iOS > App
# 4. Product Name: SamplerApp
# 5. Interface: SwiftUI
# 6. Language: Swift
# 7. Save it in /Users/jade/Documents/SamplerApp
# 8. Then copy the .swift files we created into the project

echo "Please create the Xcode project manually for now."
